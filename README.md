# AI HR Portal

The **AI HR Portal** is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the recruitment process. Job seekers can apply for jobs provided by HR through the backend. Once a candidate applies for a specific job, AI will conduct the interview rounds, generate results, and provide feedback. HR professionals can view applications, review marks and feedback, assign tasks, and access a dashboard for efficient management.
